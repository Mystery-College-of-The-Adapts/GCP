    "   - Compute Engine: \n",
    "        - Compute Engine is an infrastructure as a-service (IaaS) product. \n",
    "        - Using it, you can launch virtual machines, create networks, and attach local and remote persistent disks based on magnetic or solid state technologies. \n",
    "        - You can also design and build advanced architectures that include load-balancing and auto-scaling and that span multiple zones in a region or multiple geographical regions worldwide. \n",
    "        - Compute Engine gives you maximum flexibility and is primarily targeted at architects and system administrators.\n",
    "      \n",
    "      \n",
    "   - App Engine: \n",
    "        - App Engine is a platform as a service (PaaS) product. \n",
    "        - Using it, you can build web-scale, autoscaling applications. \n",
    "        - App Engine is targeted at software developers and provides a comprehensive collection of libraries. \n",
    "        - Using it, you can simply upload an application to the platform, and App Engine takes care of everything else.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Container Engine: \n",
    "    - Containerized applications are being explored as the next step in DevOps standard operating procedures and the next generation of application development. \n",
    "    - Docker is at the forefront of this revolution and is building an industry-wide consensus about the format and interface of application containers. \n",
    "    - An application container is enabled by a set of core innovations in the Linux kernel that Google invented almost a decade ago. \n",
    "    - This places Google at the forefront of driving container adoption among developers.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Managed VMs: \n",
    "    - Managed virtual machines are the next generation of App Engine and feature many new capabilities such as Docker formatted application containers, writable local disks, and live debugging of applications over SSH. \n",
    "    - Whereas Container Engine enables you to build sophisticated multi-tier applications where each node is a Docker container, managed VMs take care of all of them. \n",
    "    - In essence, Container Engine is an unmanaged platform for Docker-based applications, and a managed VM is a managed platform for Docker-based applications. "
